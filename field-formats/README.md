## Creating a custom Oracle function
Creating a custom Oracle function like `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION RandomUUID` to generate UUIDs can be a viable solution for managing unique identifiers during data migration, especially when transitioning data between a legacy Oracle database and a Cassandra database. Hereâ€™s how you can approach this idea and some considerations:

---

### **Why Use UUIDs in Data Migration?**
1. **Consistency Across Systems:** UUIDs provide a standard way to identify records uniquely, reducing the risk of collisions when integrating data from multiple sources.
2. **Independence from Sequence Dependencies:** Unlike sequence-based IDs, UUIDs are independent of the ordering in the legacy system, making them ideal for distributed systems like Cassandra.
3. **Mapping Correlation:** UUIDs can serve as correlation IDs between the legacy system and the target system, ensuring traceability.

---

### **Steps to Implement a UUID Function in Oracle**
Oracle does not have a built-in function for generating UUIDs, but you can create one using the `SYS_GUID()` function or leveraging Java stored procedures. Here's an example using `SYS_GUID()`:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION RandomUUID RETURN VARCHAR2 IS
BEGIN
    RETURN RAWTOHEX(SYS_GUID());
END RandomUUID;
/
```

#### **How It Works:**
- `SYS_GUID()` generates a globally unique identifier in `RAW(16)` format.
- `RAWTOHEX()` converts it to a `VARCHAR2` string in hexadecimal format, which aligns with standard UUID formatting.

You can call this function during your ETL process, for example, when inserting records into a staging table:

```sql
INSERT INTO stage_table (id, data_field1, data_field2)
VALUES (RandomUUID(), :data_field1, :data_field2);
```

---

### **Alternative: Generating UUIDs Using Java Stored Procedures**
If you need more control over UUID generation, you can use Java stored procedures in Oracle to generate standard UUIDs:

1. **Load Java Code into Oracle:**
   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE AND RESOLVE JAVA SOURCE NAMED "UUIDGenerator" AS
   import java.util.UUID;
   public class UUIDGenerator {
       public static String generate() {
           return UUID.randomUUID().toString();
       }
   }
   /
   ```

2. **Create a PL/SQL Wrapper:**
   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION RandomUUID RETURN VARCHAR2 AS
   LANGUAGE JAVA
   NAME 'UUIDGenerator.generate() return java.lang.String';
   /
   ```

This approach generates UUIDs in the standard `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` format.

---

### **Considerations for Data Migration**
1. **Deterministic UUIDs for Relationships:**
   If you need to maintain relationships (e.g., foreign keys), consider creating UUIDs based on existing fields (e.g., hashing a combination of primary keys) to ensure consistency between related records.

2. **Performance:**
   - Generating UUIDs using `SYS_GUID()` is fast and efficient in Oracle.
   - Java-based UUID generation provides more control and standardization but can be slightly slower.

3. **Staging Table Design:**
   Include a field like `LEGACY_ID` alongside the `UUID` to keep track of the original identifier for traceability.

4. **Migration Script Workflow:**
   - Extract data from the legacy system, populating the `UUID` field using the `RandomUUID` function.
   - Transform and load data into Cassandra, ensuring that UUIDs are preserved.

---

### **UUID Handling in Cassandra**
Cassandra supports UUID and TimeUUID natively. After migrating data, ensure that your Cassandra schema defines these fields appropriately:

```cql
CREATE TABLE example (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    data_field1 TEXT,
    data_field2 TEXT
);
```

---

### **Conclusion**
Creating a custom `RandomUUID` function in Oracle is a practical and efficient way to ensure unique, traceable identifiers during your ETL process. It aligns well with the distributed nature of Cassandra and can be easily integrated into your migration scripts. If you require UUIDs to follow a specific format or standard, consider the Java-based alternative for more flexibility.

## Deterministic UUIDs: What and Why

Let me clarify what I meant by deterministic UUIDs and how they relate to parent-child relationships in your migration context.

---

### **Context: Parent-Child Relationships in Data**
In a database, **parent-child relationships** often exist where one table references another. For example:
- **Parent Table:** Customers
- **Child Table:** Orders (each order belongs to a customer)

In this case, the child table (Orders) typically contains a foreign key referencing the primary key of the parent table (Customers). If you migrate these tables to a new system and generate entirely random UUIDs for each row, it becomes challenging to preserve this relationship without additional effort.

---

### **Deterministic UUIDs: What and Why**
A **deterministic UUID** is a UUID generated in such a way that the same input will always produce the same UUID. This is useful in migration for the following reasons:
1. It ensures **consistency** between related entities.
2. It makes it easy to maintain relationships without requiring extensive mapping tables.

For example, you can generate a UUID for each record in the Customers table based on its primary key. Then, for Orders, you generate UUIDs for the `customer_id` field in the Orders table using the same method, ensuring the relationship is preserved.

---

### **How to Generate Deterministic UUIDs**
To generate deterministic UUIDs, you can use hashing. Here's an example:

1. **Hash the Legacy ID:**
   - Use a cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256) to create a hash of the legacy ID.
2. **Transform the Hash into a UUID:**
   - Take part of the hash and structure it into UUID format.

**Example in Oracle PL/SQL:**
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION GenerateDeterministicUUID(input_id VARCHAR2) RETURN VARCHAR2 IS
    hashed_id RAW(32);
BEGIN
    -- Hash the input using the DBMS_CRYPTO package
    hashed_id := DBMS_CRYPTO.HASH(UTL_I18N.STRING_TO_RAW(input_id, 'AL32UTF8'), DBMS_CRYPTO.HASH_SH256);
    
    -- Return the first 16 bytes of the hash in UUID format
    RETURN SUBSTR(RAWTOHEX(hashed_id), 1, 32);
END GenerateDeterministicUUID;
/
```

When applied:
- For a customer with `legacy_id = 12345`, you generate `UUID_A`.
- For an order with `customer_id = 12345`, you reference `UUID_A` in the foreign key field.

---

### **Benefits of Deterministic UUIDs in Migration**
1. **Preservation of Relationships:** Parent-child relationships are retained seamlessly.
2. **No Need for Mapping Tables:** You avoid the need for intermediate mapping tables to track legacy IDs and new UUIDs.
3. **Consistency Across Systems:** Deterministic generation ensures repeatable and predictable results.

---

### **When to Use Deterministic vs. Random UUIDs**
- Use **deterministic UUIDs** when maintaining relationships between related entities is critical.
- Use **random UUIDs** when relationships do not depend on specific IDs or when uniqueness is the only requirement.

---

## Java-based UUID generation

If you decide to propose just the **Java-based UUID generation** approach, deterministic UUIDs can still be implemented within that framework if needed. Let me explain how **deterministic UUIDs** work and how they can be applied in your migration project.

---

### **How Deterministic UUIDs Work**

A **deterministic UUID** is generated in a repeatable manner based on a specific input, such as a legacy ID or a combination of fields. The same input will always result in the same UUID. This ensures:
1. **Consistency**: You can regenerate the UUID at any time using the same input.
2. **Relationships**: Parent-child relationships in the data are naturally preserved without needing extra mapping tables.

### **Implementation of Deterministic UUIDs in Java**

1. **Hashing the Input**:  
   Use a hashing algorithm (e.g., SHA-256) to generate a hash value from the input. This ensures a unique and deterministic output.

2. **Converting the Hash to UUID Format**:  
   Take part of the hash and format it into the standard `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` UUID structure.

---

### **Example Java Code for Deterministic UUID**

Hereâ€™s how you can implement a deterministic UUID generator in Java:

```java
import java.nio.ByteBuffer;
import java.security.MessageDigest;
import java.util.UUID;

public class DeterministicUUIDGenerator {

    public static UUID generateUUID(String input) {
        try {
            // Hash the input using SHA-256
            MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
            byte[] hashBytes = digest.digest(input.getBytes());

            // Use the first 16 bytes of the hash to create a UUID
            ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.wrap(hashBytes);
            long mostSigBits = buffer.getLong(); // First 8 bytes
            long leastSigBits = buffer.getLong(); // Next 8 bytes
            return new UUID(mostSigBits, leastSigBits);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Error generating deterministic UUID", e);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage
        String legacyId = "12345";
        UUID deterministicUUID = generateUUID(legacyId);
        System.out.println("Generated UUID: " + deterministicUUID);
    }
}
```

---

### **How It Works**
- **Input**: A unique identifier from the legacy system (e.g., `legacy_id` or a composite key like `customer_id + order_id`).
- **Process**: The input is hashed, and the resulting hash is used to create the UUID.
- **Output**: A UUID that is always the same for the same input.

For example:
- Input: `"12345"` â†’ UUID: `f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479`
- Input: `"54321"` â†’ UUID: `d94f0b68-7f6d-4a7a-bffb-0e121c4e308a`

---

### **Why Deterministic UUIDs Are Useful**
1. **Preserves Relationships**:  
   If `legacy_id = 12345` is used for both a customer and their orders, the same UUID can ensure these entities remain related in the new system.

2. **No Extra Mapping Tables**:  
   Deterministic UUIDs eliminate the need to store a mapping between legacy IDs and new UUIDs since you can regenerate the UUID from the legacy ID at any time.

3. **Scalable for Distributed Systems**:  
   This approach works well in distributed systems because the UUID is generated consistently without requiring centralized tracking.

---

### **Integrating Into Your Migration Solution**
1. **Java Stored Procedure in Oracle**:  
   Use the above Java method as a stored procedure in Oracle, wrapping it in PL/SQL for direct usage during the migration process.

2. **Cassandra Compatibility**:  
   The generated UUIDs will seamlessly integrate into Cassandra's UUID-compatible columns.

## Deterministic UUIDs via Java-based logic

Correct! If you want to use **deterministic UUIDs** in your migration solution via Java-based logic, youâ€™ll need to implement a custom Java class that generates these UUIDs deterministically. This class will then be deployed into the Oracle database and wrapped with a PL/SQL function to make it callable during the migration process. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

---

### **Steps to Implement and Use Deterministic UUIDs**

1. **Create the Java Class**  
   Develop a Java class that generates deterministic UUIDs based on an input string (like a legacy ID).

   Example:
   ```java
   import java.nio.ByteBuffer;
   import java.security.MessageDigest;
   import java.util.UUID;

   public class DeterministicUUID {
       public static String generate(String input) {
           try {
               MessageDigest digest = MessageDigest.getInstance("SHA-256");
               byte[] hash = digest.digest(input.getBytes());

               ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.wrap(hash);
               long mostSigBits = buffer.getLong();
               long leastSigBits = buffer.getLong();

               return new UUID(mostSigBits, leastSigBits).toString();
           } catch (Exception e) {
               throw new RuntimeException("Error generating deterministic UUID", e);
           }
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Compile and Load the Java Class into Oracle**
   - Compile the class into a `.class` file or a `.jar` file.
   - Use the following command in Oracle to load the Java class:
     ```sql
     LOADJAVA -user <username>/<password> DeterministicUUID.class
     ```
   This uploads the Java logic into Oracle, making it accessible as a stored procedure.

3. **Create a PL/SQL Wrapper for the Java Class**
   Wrap the Java method with a PL/SQL function to make it callable directly from SQL or PL/SQL.

   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION GenerateUUID(input_string VARCHAR2) RETURN VARCHAR2 AS
   LANGUAGE JAVA
   NAME 'DeterministicUUID.generate(java.lang.String) return java.lang.String';
   /
   ```

4. **Call the Function During Migration**
   Use the new `GenerateUUID` function in your ETL scripts. For example:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO stage_table (uuid, data_field1, data_field2)
   VALUES (GenerateUUID(:legacy_id), :data_field1, :data_field2);
   ```

---

### **Why This Setup?**
- **Flexibility**: Allows for deterministic UUID generation thatâ€™s reusable and can be adjusted or enhanced in Java without modifying PL/SQL logic.
- **Integration**: Wrapping Java logic with PL/SQL provides a seamless way to call it from Oracle-based ETL processes.
- **Control**: Gives precise control over the UUID format and ensures relationships between entities are preserved.

---

### **Advantages**
1. **Standardization**: You can use standard Java libraries (like `java.util.UUID`) while still leveraging Oracle's environment.
2. **Scalability**: Easily extendable if additional deterministic behaviors are required.
3. **Consistency**: You guarantee that the same legacy ID always produces the same UUID.

## Reverse Mapping

Unfortunately, **going back from a UUID to the legacy ID is not possible** when using a hash-based deterministic UUID generation approach. This is because hashing (e.g., using SHA-256) is a **one-way process**â€”designed specifically to prevent the original input from being retrieved.

---

### **Why Reverse Mapping Isn't Possible**
- **Hashing Is Irreversible**: Hash functions like SHA-256 produce a unique, fixed-length output from a given input. However, this process is irreversible because it discards information and is non-bijective (many inputs can produce the same hash in rare cases, though this is very unlikely with good hash functions).
- **UUID Is a Subset**: In our deterministic UUID example, we only use a portion of the hash output (e.g., the first 16 bytes). This further reduces any chance of recovering the original input.

---

### **Alternatives for Reverse Mapping**
If you need the ability to retrieve the legacy ID for a given UUID, you need a mapping strategy. Here are some approaches:

#### **1. Maintain a Mapping Table**
   - **How It Works**:
     During migration, store a mapping between the `legacy_id` and the generated UUID in a dedicated table.
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE uuid_mapping (
         legacy_id VARCHAR2(50) PRIMARY KEY,
         uuid VARCHAR2(36) UNIQUE
     );

     INSERT INTO uuid_mapping (legacy_id, uuid)
     VALUES (:legacy_id, GenerateUUID(:legacy_id));
     ```

   - **Advantages**:
     - Simple and reliable.
     - Allows bidirectional lookup (UUID â†’ Legacy ID and Legacy ID â†’ UUID).
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Requires additional storage.
     - Needs careful synchronization during migration.

---

#### **2. Embed the Legacy ID into the UUID**
   Instead of using a hash-based deterministic UUID, you can encode the `legacy_id` directly into the UUID itself.

   - **Approach**:
     - Use part of the UUID to store the legacy ID (e.g., last 12 bytes for a numeric `legacy_id`).
     - For example:
       ```
       UUID Structure: | Random Part (16 bytes) | Legacy ID (12 bytes) |
       ```

     Example in Java:
     ```java
     public static UUID generateWithEmbeddedID(String legacyId) {
         long randomPart = UUID.randomUUID().getMostSignificantBits();
         long legacyPart = Long.parseLong(legacyId);
         return new UUID(randomPart, legacyPart);
     }

     public static String extractLegacyID(UUID uuid) {
         return String.valueOf(uuid.getLeastSignificantBits());
     }
     ```

   - **Advantages**:
     - Provides a reversible process (can extract `legacy_id` directly from the UUID).
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Limits the randomness of the UUID (may not fully comply with UUID standards).
     - Legacy ID must fit within the size constraints (e.g., must be numeric and not exceed 12 bytes).

---

#### **3. Hybrid Approach**
   Combine deterministic UUIDs for entities that donâ€™t need reverse mapping with a mapping table for those that do. This balances storage concerns with flexibility.

---

### **Best Option for Your Case**
If you need guaranteed **traceability back to the legacy ID**, the **mapping table approach** is the most robust and straightforward solution. It requires some additional storage but aligns well with your migration process.

If traceability isnâ€™t critical and UUIDs are used solely for forward compatibility, deterministic UUIDs without reverse mapping are sufficient.
