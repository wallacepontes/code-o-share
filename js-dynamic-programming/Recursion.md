## Introduction
An overview of recursion, a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.

## What Is Recursion?
Introduction to recursion and its two main parts: the base case and the recursive case.

## Explaining Recursion via ATM Analogy
Using an ATM withdrawal process to explain how recursion works by breaking a task into smaller steps.

## Explaining Recursion via Essay Revision Analogy
A simplified analogy using essay revision to showcase how recursion refines and revisits tasks until a base case is met.

## Summarizing What Recursion Is
Recursion can be seen as a function calling itself to solve smaller instances of a problem, with a clear base case to prevent infinite loops.

## Why & Why Not Recursion
Exploring the benefits (elegance, simplicity) and drawbacks (memory usage, performance) of recursion.

## Understanding The Call Stack
Explanation of the call stack, which stores information about active subroutines in a program, especially important in recursive functions.

## Call Stack Analogy
A practical analogy comparing the call stack to a stack of plates, where each new call adds a plate, and plates are removed as calls are completed.

## Recursion With Strings Introduction
Introduction to solving string-related problems using recursion.

## String Reversal Explanation
Explanation of how recursion can reverse a string by breaking it down into smaller substrings.

## String Reversal Call Stack Animation
An animated visualization of how the call stack behaves during the string reversal process.

## Palindrome Explanation
Discussion on using recursion to check if a string is a palindrome by comparing its characters.

## Palindrome Call Stack Animation
A visual representation of the recursive process for palindrome checking, with each function call added to the stack.

## Recursion With Numbers
Applying recursion to solve numeric problems.

### Decimal To Binary Explanation
Explanation of converting a decimal number to binary using recursion.

### Decimal To Binary Code & Debug
Code walkthrough and debugging session for implementing decimal to binary conversion.

Animation demonstrating the recursive insertion of values into a binary search tree.

### Insert Value Into Binary Search Tree Code Walkthrough
Code walkthrough for inserting values into a binary search tree using recursion.

### Insert Value Into Binary Search Tree Call Stack Animation
Visualization of the call stack during the recursive insertion process in a binary search tree.

### Print All Leaf Nodes Explanation
Explaining how recursion can be used to print all leaf nodes in a binary tree.

### Print All Leaf Nodes Code & Debug
Code walkthrough and debugging session for printing all leaf nodes recursively.

## Graphs
Using recursion in graph traversal.

### Depth-First Search Animation
Animated demonstration of depth-first search (DFS), a recursive algorithm for traversing graphs.
