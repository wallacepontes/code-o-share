/**
 * The Command design pattern is a behavioral pattern that 
 * encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for deferred 
 * execution or manipulation of requests. It is a behavioral 
 * design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object 
 * that contains all information about the request. 
 * This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, 
 * delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations.
 * Here's an example of the Command pattern in Java: 
 * 
 * This example defines a Light class, a TurnOnLightCommand class that 
 * implements the Command interface, and a RemoteControl class that uses 
 * a Command object to turn on a light. The Client class creates an instance 
 * of the Light class and an instance of the TurnOnLightCommand class, and 
 * then it uses the RemoteControl class to turn on the light. 
 * By encapsulating the request in an object, you can pass around the request 
 * with all the information necessary to execute it, rather than just the request 
 * itself.
